# Project Structure

This project consists of multiple folders that organize the various components of the CNC Ink system. Below is an overview of the key directories and their purposes.

## Operating Principles

The CNC Ink system operates using a series of coordinated actions controlled by the provided code and schematics. This includes moving parts, managing ink delivery, and ensuring precise operation during printing tasks.

## CAD Folder

The **CAD** folder contains the CAD models and drawings used for the design and assembly of the CNC machine. These files are essential for understanding the physical layout and structure of the machine.

## Schematics Folder

The **Schematics** folder houses the electrical schematics that detail the connections and components of the CNC Ink system. These diagrams are crucial for anyone looking to build or troubleshoot the machine.

## Code Folder

The **Code** folder contains the program code that controls the CNC machine's operations. It includes the algorithms for movement, ink application, and interactions with the hardware components.
